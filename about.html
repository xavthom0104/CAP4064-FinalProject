<h1> About </h1>
<p>The Black Creatives Hub was created as a platform support the local numerous talented artists, musicians and other creatives in the Tallahassee area.
Trying to promote one's work by just posting on social media can lead to a small turnout due to the algorithms not working in their favor.  Social media users 
may not see the artists' works regardless of whether or not they are following them. The Black Creatives Hub seeks to alleviate this by centralizing a platform
exclusively created for them. New music video? It's there and available. New cannvas piece? It's ready to be seen. New website for personal business? Willing 
customers can quickly tap into it. The Black Creatives Hub will let creatives reach the fan followings that they deserve!
